# decision_tree_implementation

Implemented decision tree to predict if a mushroom is poisonous or edible using a set of features on which the model is trained. 

1. I have used the pandas library to avail vectorized data structures(dataframes and series). 
2. Achieved an accuracy rate of 93% on training data and 64% on test data.
3. Performed random tree classifier by running the above model 10, 50 and 100 times to achieve better accuracy.
